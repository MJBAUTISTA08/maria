    In college now, the experience are overflowing or should i say, my heart are always happy and my mind are always calm. I included this picture with 2 other people that deeply connected with me. They were my companions in activities, in groupings, and at my breakdown point. college is not easy for me, apart from not liking my course, I also quit studying for two years to become a breadwinner, and now, they help me keep up with the activities, my studies have been easy somehow because of them. hoping and praying that they will be my friends until I graduate.</h3>
