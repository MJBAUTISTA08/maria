    This is secret and something I don't want to share. I want to be seriously a writer, I want to write everything what on my mind, and imaginations, I am happy when I can write stories that have meaning, I want to travel around the world and write everything what i see. I was a secret writer when I was 17, but due to my seriously damage mentalheath, i lost . I didnt publish or upload my first ever stories in any websites, i just found my self selling it, and deleting my account.  And after the damages and the struggles, at 21 i want to start again. Im happy to have a dream again at badly want to be a writer. Just this time, i dont want to lose again, i want to be a winner. Winner of my own goals and dreams in life. :))</h3>
